              🚀 I’m a passionate and results-driven full-stack developer with
              over 8 years of experience delivering modern, scalable software
              solutions. My expertise spans across artificial intelligence (AI)
              🤖, full-stack web development 🌐, and advanced video streaming
              technologies 🎥 — allowing me to contribute to a wide range of
              projects, from intelligent automation systems to real-time media
              platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              💻 I specialize in Python and JavaScript (Vue.js, Node.js), and
              have hands-on experience with machine learning, deep learning, and
              data analytics 📊. I’ve used tools such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and
              scikit-learn to build smart, adaptive applications tailored to
              solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              🧱 On the web side, I’ve developed full-stack systems using REST
              APIs, responsive front-end frameworks, and cloud-based deployment
              pipelines ☁️. I also bring deep experience in real-time video
              technologies like WebRTC, FFmpeg, RTMP, and HLS, enabling the
              creation of efficient, interactive, and scalable streaming
              platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              🧠 I thrive on solving complex challenges, improving performance
              ⚙️, and writing clean, maintainable code. Whether working
              independently or collaborating with cross-functional teams 🤝, I
              bring clear communication, adaptability, and a strong commitment
              to building impactful, user-centered technology.
